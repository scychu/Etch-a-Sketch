This is Etch a Sketch for The ODIN Project<br>
The default will have 10 x 10 squares for you.<br>
There will be 3 buttons with different function for each:<br>
Resize Grid: 

Check your “elements” pane to see if the elements have actually shown up but are somehow hidden.<br>
Go willy-nilly and add console.log statements in your JavaScript to see if it’s actually being loaded.<br>
Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.<br>
Hint: “hovering” is what happens when your mouse enters a div and ends when your mouse leaves it.. you can set up event listeners for either of those events as a starting point.
There are multiple ways to change the color of the divs, including:<br>
adding a new class to the div<br>
changing the div’s background color using JavaScript.<br>
Add a button to the top of the screen which will clear the current grid and send the user a popup asking for how many squares per side to make the new grid. Once entered the new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g. 960px wide) and now you’ve got a new sketch pad.
Research button tags in HTML and how you can make a JavaScript function run when one is clicked.<br>
Also check out prompts
You should be able to enter 64 and have a brand new 64x64 grid pop up without changing the total amount of pixels used
(Optional): Instead of just changing the color of your grid from black to white (for example) have each pass through it with the mouse change to a completely random RGB value. Then try having each pass just add another 10% of black to it so that only after 10 passes is the square completely black.
